# Two-Pass-Privacy-Preserving-Authenticated-Key-Agreement-Scheme-for-Smart-Grid

<p>To plan a genuinely secure verified key arrangement convention for shrewd matrix and make a few commitments to this field, this work presents our new validated key agreement plan for smart grid utilizing Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) certain declarations as the building block.</p>

<p>here in the output first we declare two integer values 3000 and 10000, which means the random number will be between 3000 to 10000. so we get our public key 3510 for the smart metre and we get our public key 7628 for the service provider. we get our private key 5034 for the smart metre and we get our private key 7911 for the service provider. And we get our secret key for the smart meter and service provider 1054.</p>
